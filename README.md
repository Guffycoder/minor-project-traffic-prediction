# Traffic Prediction AI Model 🚦

## Overview
This project implements an AI-based traffic prediction system using a hybrid deep learning approach. It combines ST3DNet for spatial feature extraction with LSTM/GRU networks for temporal sequence modeling to predict urban traffic congestion patterns.

## Problem Statement
Urban traffic congestion causes increased travel time, fuel consumption, and pollution. Accurate traffic prediction is essential for intelligent transportation systems and smart city planning.

## Solution
The system leverages:
- **ST3DNet** for capturing spatial traffic dependencies
- **LSTM / GRU** for modeling temporal traffic sequences
- Ensemble and comparative evaluation across multiple models

## Features
- Spatio-temporal traffic prediction
- Multi-step forecasting
- Model comparison and evaluation
- Visualization of predictions and error curves

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Deep Learning (LSTM, GRU, ST3DNet)
- Matplotlib

## Project Structure
- Training scripts for multiple models
- Evaluation and comparison utilities
- Visualization and plotting scripts
- Dataset and preprocessed sequences

## Use Case
Designed for intelligent transportation systems and smart city traffic management solutions to enable data-driven congestion forecasting.
